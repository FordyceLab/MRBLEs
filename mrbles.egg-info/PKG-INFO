Description: MRBLEs Analysis Package
        =======================
        
        This project aims to provide a package to **find**, **decode**, **extract**,
        **analyze** and MRBLEs using a set of images.
        
        This package provides the tools to: (1) **find** the MRBLEs in a monochrome
        brightfield microscopy image; (2) **decode** the MRBLEs beads by spectral
        unmxing, using reference spectra, and then spectrally decode the found beads
        using Iterative Closest Point Matching and Gaussian Mixture Modeling; (3)
        **extract**, statistical values of interest in additional fluorescence
        channels using the morphology of the MRBLEs, their locations, and respective
        code; (4) **analyze** affinity information based on titrations of MRBLEs
        assays.

        MRBLEs (Microspheres with Ratiometric Barcode Lanthanide Encoding) rely on
        spectral multiplexing to track analytes throughout an experiment. In these
        assays, we can create microspheres containing > 1,000 unique ratios of
        lanthanide nanophosphors that can be uniquely identified via imaging alone.
        We are currently developing new assays that use these microspheres to
        understand how signaling proteins recognize their peptide substrates and to
        improve our ability to extract information from single cells.
